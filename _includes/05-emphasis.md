I code in _Python_ _JavaScript_ and _Java_ (sometimes).

I believe strongly in automation as not only a tool, but a goal: if you have to do things more than once, automation can be a life-saver. I'm learning _PowerShell_ and _bash_ as shells, but for automation, I've never found anything faster or more reliable than _Python_
